              I'm a web developer / product person. Most of my work in the past 4 years has been around startups.
              In 2010, I started a company called
              %a{href: "https://www.giftrocket.com"} GiftRocket
              with a few friends.
              I currently work at

            %p
              I currently spend my time working on various tech projects, reading, and playing sports.
